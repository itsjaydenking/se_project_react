# WTWR (What to Wear?)

WTWR is a responsive React web application that recommends clothing based on the current weather in your location. This project was developed as part of my learning journey in modern frontend development, focusing on React, responsive design, and API integration. The app is designed to provide a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices, and demonstrates my ability to build interactive, real-world applications.
